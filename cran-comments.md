## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Updated redirecting URLs, changed "http" to "https", and otherwise added trailing backslashes to URLs in README.md.

## Test environments
* local Ubuntu 20.04 install, R 4.0.4
* Github Actions: ubuntu-20.04 (devel, release), windows-latest (release) macOS-latest (release).

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs.
There is one NOTE: "checking CRAN incoming feasibility".

## Downstream dependencies
This package has no downstream dependencies.
